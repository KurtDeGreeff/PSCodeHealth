This is a PowerShell module which generates (and reports on) quality and maintainability metrics for PowerShell code contained in scripts, modules or directories.  
These metrics relate to :  
  - Length of functions  
  - Complexity of functions  
  - Code smells, styling issues and violations of best practices (using PSScriptAnalyzer)  
  - Tests and test coverage (using Pester to run tests)  
  - Comment-based help in functions
